# Vendor Performance Analysis
# Overview
This project evaluates the performance of multiple vendors and provides insights into **sales prices, freight costs, and profitability**.  
It involves **data extraction and transformation using SQL**, **data analysis and hypothesis testing in Python**, and **visualization in Power BI**.  

The goal is to identify high-performing vendors, analyze freight impact on sales margins, and recommend strategies for cost optimization.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess vendor performance based on sales and freight data.  
- Understand the relationship between freight cost and sales price.  
- Perform **hypothesis testing** to verify if freight significantly impacts total sales.  
- Build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for visualization and decision-making.

- ## 🗂️ Dataset Description
| Table Name | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **purchases** | Purchase transactions including purchase date, vendor, brand, quantity, and amount. |
| **purchase_prices** | Actual vs purchase price for each vendor-brand combination. |
| **vendor_invoice** | Vendor-level invoice summary including freight and total cost. |
| **sales** | Sales transactions with brand, sales quantity, selling price, and revenue. |

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
SQL (Common Table Expressions, Joins, Filtering)
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
Power BI (Interactive Visualizations)

## 🔄 Workflow Description

| Step | Stage | Tool | Description |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| **1. Data Loading** | Data files (CSV) were imported into SQL database | **SQL (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)** | Loaded all raw data tables 
| **2. Data Connection** | SQL–Python link created | **Python (SQLAlchemy)** | Created a **database engine** in Jupyter Notebook to connect Python with SQL for querying and ingestion. |
| **3. Data Ingestion & ETL** | Transformation & Cleaning | **SQL** | Cleaned duplicates, handled null values, calculated freight %, and joined tables for unified dataset. |
| **4. Data Analysis** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | **Python + SQL in Jupyter** | Used `pandas`, `numpy`, and SQL queries for descriptive statistics and trend analysis. |
| **5. Hypothesis Testing** | Statistical validation | **Python (scipy.stats)** | Performed hypothesis testing to evaluate if **freight costs significantly affect sales performance**. |
| **6. Visualization & Dashboard** | Business insights | **Power BI** | Designed an interactive dashboard highlighting vendor sales, freight %, and profitability comparison. |
| **7. Reporting** | Documentation | **Markdown (README)** | Summarized insights, findings, and recommendations in this GitHub report. |



## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Top Vendors by Sales and Purchases**  
   - Vendor A and Vendor B contribute the highest sales and purchase volumes.  
   - These vendors are critical for revenue generation and procurement efficiency.

2. **Brand Performance**  
   - Brand X and Brand Y consistently achieve the highest sales across multiple vendors.  
   - Highlighting top brands helps focus inventory and marketing strategies.

3. **Freight Cost Analysis**  
   - Vendors with higher freight percentages often show lower net profitability.  
   - Optimizing freight cost can directly improve margins.

4. **Profitability Trends**  
   - Vendor-brand combinations with high sales but low freight show the best profitability.  
   - This analysis identifies which vendors to prioritize for scale-up.

5. **Statistical Insights (Hypothesis Testing)**  
   - Freight cost has a measurable impact on sales performance (p-value < 0.05).  
   - Data-driven decisions can be made to negotiate freight rates or adjust pricing strategies.
